Mockito provides several methods to create mock objects:

Using the static mock() method.
Using the @Mock annotation.

If you use the @Mock annotation, you must trigger the creation of annotated objects. The MockitoRule allows this.
It invokes the static method MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this) to populate the annotated fields. Alternatively you can
use @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class).
